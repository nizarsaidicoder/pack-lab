# Visual Pathfinding Simulator – Vue Roadmap / Todo List

- [x] Initialize Vue 3 project (Vite recommended)
- [ ] Implement **interactive grid**:
  - Draw cells
  - Set start & end points
- [ ] Allow **placing obstacles** and **weighted tiles**
- [ ] Make grid **resizable** (e.g., 20×20, 50×50)
- [ ] Store grid internally as a **2D array or graph**
- [ ] Create basic **Vue components**:
  - Grid
  - Cell
  - Toolbar (start/end, obstacle, weight selector)

---

- [ ] Implement **BFS** with real-time visualization
- [ ] Implement **DFS** with visualization
- [ ] Animate **visited nodes** (color gradient)
- [ ] Show **final path** after algorithm finishes
- [ ] Add **pause/play/reset** functionality
- [ ] Bind algorithm state to Vue **reactive data**

---

- [ ] Implement **Dijkstra** with weighted tiles
- [ ] Implement **A*** with selectable heuristics (Manhattan / Euclidean)
- [ ] Implement **Greedy Best-First Search**
- [ ] Update visualization to show **priority queue / costs**
- [ ] Add **legend** for node states (visited, frontier, path)

---

- [ ] Enable **running multiple algorithms in parallel**
- [ ] Use **Web Workers** for parallel computation
- [ ] Visualize **different algorithms simultaneously** with unique colors
- [ ] Show **performance comparison** (execution time, nodes visited)

---

- [ ] Create **metrics panel**:
  - Nodes visited
  - Path length
  - Execution time
  - Parallel speedup comparison
- [ ] Display metrics in **real-time charts** (bar charts or counters)
- [ ] Optional: highlight **most efficient algorithm** dynamically

---

- [ ] Allow **dynamic obstacles** during algorithm execution
- [ ] Implement **maze generation algorithms** (Prim / Recursive Backtracking)
- [ ] Compare **heuristics visually** for A*
- [ ] Add **speed slider** for animation control
- [ ] Add **tooltips** explaining algorithm steps

---

- [ ] Improve **grid appearance** (colors, animations, gradients)
- [ ] Enhance **algorithm visualization** (smooth transitions, highlighting)
- [ ] Make **dashboard interactive**
- [ ] Add **tooltips or explanations** for metrics & algorithm steps
- [ ] Make project **responsive** for different screen sizes

---

- [ ] Write **README**: project description, instructions, tech stack
- [ ] Add **screenshots/GIFs** showing algorithm in action
- [ ] Draw **UML diagrams**:
  - Modules
  - Data structures
  - Workflow
- [ ] Publish project on **GitHub** with clean, commented code
- [ ] Optionally, add **demo link** with GitHub Pages

---

✅ **Outcome:**  
By the end, you will have a **fully functional, visual, interactive pathfinding simulator** using Vue, covering **algorithms, parallelism, and clean architecture** — perfect for your SIL portfolio.
